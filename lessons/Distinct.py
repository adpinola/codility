# Write a function

# def solution(A)

# that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

# For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

 # A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 # A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
# the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

def solution(A):
    # I should not count ocurrences because the
    # range of values is too high
    # I better sort and then find the times the values change
    N = len(A)
    A.sort()
    distinctValues = 1 # if the array has only one value I have ONE distinct value!
    for i in range(N - 1):
         # if the current value and the next occurrence are different
        if A[i] != A[i+1]:
            distinctValues += 1
    return distinctValues
